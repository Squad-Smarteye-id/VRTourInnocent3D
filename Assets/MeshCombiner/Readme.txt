Multi-Material - Static Mesh Combiner
Lylek Games

- For use in the Editor -
This script is design to combine multiple meshes into a single mesh. To do this,
first create an empty game object, then drag and your meshes inside so that they are children of the empty gameobject.
Now simply select the empty game object and press Tools > Combine > Static Meshes! All done! Feel free to take a look
at the components of the once empty game object. You will find that the CombineMeshes script has been added. You may
use this script to revert the empty game object back to normal and reactivate the child meshes.

You can save your combined meshes as prefabs. After using the combine method, a save option will be available
in the Editor, via the CombineMeshes script.

You have the option to save destructive or non destructive. Saving destructive will destroy all child gameObjects.
Saving non-destructive will preserve all child gameObjects.

Your prefab, along with the mesh data that is created, will be named after your active GameObject.

**Please leave a rating and review! Even a small review may help immensely with prioritizing updates.**
(Assets with few and infrequent reviews/ratings tend to have less of a priority and my be late or miss-out on crucial compatibility updates, or even be depricated.)
Thank you! =)
